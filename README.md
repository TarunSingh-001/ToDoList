# ToDoList
I ceated a simple To-Do List app using Python that runs in the terminal. It lets me add, view, and remove tasks easily.
I used basic Python features like:
lists to store tasks
if-else and while loops for the menu
the open() function to save tasks in a text file (tasks.txt) so they donâ€™t disappear after closing the program.
